# COEN 313 Project
## David Krakauer, Andrew Wang
### Project Tasks
1. Understanding Trace Format and unzipping long traces Download long traces(one day work)--> 10/20
2. Analysis of traces (0.5 Weeks Work)  --> 10/24
Count percentage of  T/NT branches in trace file.
Count number of distinct branch instructions in trace file. 
For the following task, you need to find the misprediction rate (0<m<1)
3. Simple dynamic branch prediction techniques ( 1 week work)  --> 11/3
1-bit predictor    (10 bits of address)
2-bit predictor (use saturating counter implementation)   (10 bits of address)
 3-bit predictor  (use saturating counter implementation)   (10 bits of address)
4. More advanced dynamic predictor techniques (2.5  week work) --> 11/24
Correlating predictor (global) (5, 1) predictor with 5 bits of address
Correlating predictor (local)  (5,1) (5 bits of address every address patter has its own shift register
Gshare  (10-bit shift register and 10 bits of address)
5. Custom advanced predictor (selected by group) (1.5 week work) --> 12/4
